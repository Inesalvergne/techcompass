<h2>What is a Coding Challenge?</h2>

<p>A &quot;<a href="https://support.microverse.org/en/articles/3047108-what-are-the-microverse-coding-challenges" target="_blank">coding challenge</a>&quot; is a programming assignment that tests the abilities of software engineers. Because coding is a must-have skill for a software developer, it is critical to test whether candidates can code effectively. It is basically the first phase before a <strong>technical interview</strong>. Even if you aren&#x27;t looking for a job, there are a lot of programming challenges that you can take part in to improve your skills.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>‍<strong>Tip #1. Master a Language</strong></h2>

<p>The ideal approach is to focus on one programming language at a time. For example, if you are learning C++, learn it from scratch. Coding challenges can be filled with a variety of questionable code, and you should be capable of debugging a program without difficulty. </p>

<p>This can only be accomplished by sharpening your technical skills in a specific programming language, to prepare, in this case, for a future C++ challenge. This approach will help you move quickly through more difficult problems and give you an advantage in the interview process.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>‍<strong>Tip #2. Understand Programming Paradigms.</strong></h2>

<p>Programming paradigms are basically a method to solve similar problems or perform certain tasks using programming languages. With so many programming paradigms available, it would be beneficial to learn at least one. These programming paradigms include:</p>
<br>
<h4>Imperative Programming Paradigm</h4>

<p>The term &quot;imperative&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;Impero,&quot; which means &quot;I command.&quot; You give the computer small tasks to complete, and it completes them one at a time and reports back.</p>

<p>The paradigm is made up of several statements, and the result is saved after they have all been executed. It requires you to write a set of instructions that tell the computer what to do step-by-step. </p>

<code><strong><br/></strong>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br/>int main()<br/>{<br/>    int sum = 0;<br/>    sum += 2;<br/>    sum += 4;<br/>    sum += 6;<br/>    sum += 8;<br/>    sum += 10;<br/>    sum += 12;<br/>    sum += 14;<br/>    sum += 16;<br/>    sum += 18;<br/>    sum += 20;<br/>     printf(&quot;The sum is: %d\n&quot;, sum); //prints-&gt; The sum is 110 <br/>return 0;<br/></code>

<p>The order of the steps is critical in an imperative programming paradigm because a specific step will have different consequences depending on the current values of variables when it is executed.</p>

<p>There are different types of programming paradigms</p>
<br>
<h4>Procedural Programming Paradigm </h4>

<p>Procedural programming allows for the division of instructions into smaller procedures. The procedural paradigm approach shown below helps you find the sum of the first ten natural numbers to demonstrate:</p>

<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br/>int main()<br/>{<br/>    int sum = 0;<br/>    int i =0;<br/>    for(i=1;i&lt;111;i++){<br/>        sum += i;<br/>    }<br/>    printf(&quot;The sum is: %d\n&quot;, sum); //prints-&gt; The sum is 110<br/>    return 0;</code>
<br>
<h4>Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm</h4>

<p>Because of its unique advantages, such as code modularity and the ability to directly associate real-world business problems in terms of code, OOP is the most popular programming paradigm with key features like Class, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<code><br/>public class Main<br/>{<br/>	public static void main(String[] args) {<br/>		Addition obj = new Addition();<br/>		obj.num = 20;<br/>		int answer = obj.addValues();<br/>		System.out.println(&quot;The sum is = &quot;+answer); //prints-&gt; The sum is 110<br/>	}<br/>}<br/>class Addition {<br/>    int sum =0;<br/>    int num =0;<br/>    int addValues(){<br/>        for(int i=1; i&lt;=num;i++){<br/>            sum += i;<br/>        }<br/>        return sum;<br/>    }<br/>}</code>
<br>
<h4>‍<strong>‍</strong>Parallel Processing Programming Paradigm</h4>

<p>Parallel processing is the division of program instructions among multiple processors. A parallel processing system divides up multiple processors to run a program in less time. Languages that support the parallel processing strategy include C/C++ and NESL. </p>
<br>
<h4>Declarative Programming Paradigm</h4>

<p>The main distinction here is that the imperative paradigm tells you how to do something, whereas declarative paradigm tells you what to do. In this type of programming, the paradigm programmer defines what the program must accomplish without specifying how it must be implemented. In other words, the approach focuses on what needs to be accomplished rather than how to accomplish it. There are two types of declarative programming paradigms. </p>
<br>
<h4>Logic Programming Paradigm</h4>

<p>The logic programming paradigm approaches problem-solving declaratively. It is founded on formal logic. The logic programming paradigm is made up of facts and clauses rather than instructions. It uses everything it knows to create a world where all of those facts and clauses are true. The emphasis in logical programming is on the problem and the knowledge base. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<code>{% code-block language=&quot;js&quot; %}<br/>sum of two number in prolog:<br/>  predicates<br/>  sumoftwonumber(integer, integer)<br/>clauses<br/>  sum(0, 0).<br/>   sum(n, r):-<br/>        n1=n-1,<br/>        sum(n1, r1),<br/>        r=r1+n</code>

<p>This paradigm supports languages like Absys, Prolog, ALF, Ciao, and Alice.</p>
<br>
<h4>The Functional Programming Paradigm</h4>

<p>The functional programming paradigm has mathematical roots and is language agnostic. The execution of a series of mathematical functions is the fundamental principle of this paradigm. You put together a program of short functions. Every line of the code is contained within a function. The function&#x27;s variables are all scoped. </p>

<p>In the functional programming paradigm, functions do not modify any values outside their scope, and they are not affected by any values outside their scope. This paradigm supports languages like Racket, JavaScript, Haskell, Scala, Clojure, and OCaml. </p>
<br>
<h4>Database Programming Approach</h4>

<p>This programming methodology is built around data and how it moves. Rather than hard-coding a series of steps, program statements are defined by data. A database program will beat the heart of any business information system, providing file creation, data entry, update, query, and reporting functions. Several programming languages have been developed primarily for database applications. As an example, consider SQL. It is used to filter, transform, aggregate (data such as computing statistics), or call other programs on structured data streams. As a result, it has a wide range of applications. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<code>{% code-block language=&quot;js&quot; %}<br/>CREATE DATABASE databaseAddress;<br/>CREATE TABLE Addr (<br/>    PersonID int,<br/>    LastName varchar(200),<br/>    FirstName varchar(200),<br/>    Address varchar(200),<br/>    City varchar(200),<br/>    State varchar(200)<br/>);</code>

<p>Programming paradigms reduce programme complexity. When writing code, every programmer must use a paradigm based approach. </p>
<br><br>
<h3><strong>Tip #3. Get to Know Data Structures</strong></h3>

<p>Data structures and algorithms are the heart of programming. Data structures act as the foundation for all programming languages. You can improve your programming logic for a programming language if you understand its data structure. You should start with the language&#x27;s data structures if you want to learn how to work with it. </p>

<p>The most common data structures include <strong>Heap, Graph, Tree, HashMap, Stack, Linked List, Array, and Queue</strong>. On the other hand, the most common algorithm types include two pointers, sorting, bit manipulation, string manipulation, dynamic programming, and backtracking. </p>
<p>Some of these may appear difficult at first, but if you want to land an interview at one of the top tech firms, you should devote more time to what you find difficult and master each of these.</p>
<br><br>
<h3><strong>Tip #4. Time and Space Complexity</strong></h3>

<p>There are some problems that have more than one solution. So, it is essential to learn how to reach the best solution to solve a specific problem. When looking at an algorithm, you should consider time and space complexity. </p>
<br>
<h4>Time Complexity</h4>

<p>The time complexity of an algorithm is a measure of how long it takes an algorithm to run as a function of the input length. It&#x27;s worth noting that the time it takes to run is determined by the length of the input rather than the system’s actual execution time. </p>

<p>To determine the time complexity of an algorithm, it is assumed that one operation takes a constant time C, and the total operations for an input length on N are then calculated. </p>

<p>Consider the following scenario to understand the computation process better: Assume you are trying to figure out if a pair (X, Y) occurs in an array A of N elements with a sum of Z. The simplest approach is to look at each pair and see if it meets the provided criteria.</p>

<p>The pseudo-code is as follows:</p>

<code><br/>int a[n];<br/>for(int i = 0;i &lt; n;i++)<br/>  cin &gt;&gt; a[i]<br/>for(int i = 0;i &lt; n;i++)<br/>  for(int j = 0;j &lt; n;j++)<br/>    if(i!=j &amp;&amp; a[i]+a[j] == z)<br/>       return true<br/>return false</code>
<br>
<h4>Space Complexity</h4>

<p>An algorithm&#x27;s space complexity measures how much space it takes to run as a function of the length of the input. Consider the following scenario: the problem of determining the frequency of array elements.</p>

<p>The pseudo-code is as follows: </p>

<code><br/> int freq[n];<br/>int a[n];<br/>for(int i = 0; i&lt;n; i++)<br/>{<br/>   cin&gt;&gt;a[i];<br/>   freq[a[i]]++;<br/>} </code>
<br>
<br>
<h3>‍<strong>Tip #5. Look at Other People’s Code</strong></h3>

<p>Reviewing other programmers&#x27; code helps you understand the format, design patterns,  styling, and naming conventions consistency throughout the code. For that, you can find and explore the online communities of programmers like <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/stash-590257906.html" target="_blank">Stash</a>, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=code_review_blog" target="_blank">Codeacademy Forums</a>, and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a>.  </p>

<p>When you take part in code review platforms like GitHub and Stash, you need a pull request. This means the original programmer will add you as a reviewer, and when you finish your code review, the website will track all changes you make. You could also be conducting an internal code review at work, either in person or through a version control system that your company has implemented.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>‍<strong>Tip #6. Plan your Strategy to Deal with the Coding Challenge</strong></h3>

<p>Many learners often jump right into the project without a proper strategy and plan. This is one of the most common mistakes. Experienced developers make sure to have a strategy and a comprehensive project plan. In order to plan your strategy, you need to consider the following things.</p>
<br>
<h4>Step 1: Choose a project that excites you</h4>

<p>Always start by deciding what project you want to work on. There are numerous suggestions suitable for various ability levels available on the internet. Because you&#x27;ll be investing a lot of time and effort into this project, make sure it&#x27;s something that stimulates and pleases you. If you have a project concept that displays your uniqueness, don&#x27;t be scared to overlook common project subjects!</p>
<br>
<h4>Step 2: Find similar projects online</h4>
<p>Look online for other people who have worked on similar tasks after you&#x27;ve come up with an idea. Many programmers post their work on the internet in order to get feedback and influence others. There are innumerable projects to examine, particularly in the open-source community.</p>
<p>You can upload your project after each phase to see what your peers have to say about how to improve it. The online community is eager to assist students such as you! It&#x27;s not a bad idea to obtain a second opinion to see where you can improve.</p>
<br>
<h4>Step 3: Choose the tools and your language. </h4>
<p>Another step is to choose the language and tools you&#x27;ll use to develop your project. Choose a language to learn if you wish to learn more than one. If you&#x27;re undecided about language, think about what kind of language would be most beneficial to the project. The following are the languages you can choose from.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul role="list">
   <li>For Mobile apps: Object-C, JavaScript, Swift, and Java</li>
   <li>For Web apps: HTML/CSS, TypeScript, PHP, Ruby and JavaScript.</li>
   <li>For Big Data: Clojure, Scala, Python, and Java</li>
   <li>For Data Visualization: C#, R, Python, and Java</li>
   <li>Machine Learning and Analytics: Julia, Python, R, and Clojure</li>
   <li>Enterprise applications: ErLang, C++, C#, Java</li>
</ul>
<p>To write your code, you will also need a text editor. The most popular text editors are Notepad++, Sublime Text, and Vim. Choose an editor with auto-complete tools, FTP integration, find and replace functions, folder management systems, and syntax highlighting. </p>
<br>
<h4>Step 4: Map the architecture of the project</h4>
<p>You can make the architecture of your project with sticky notes, or digitally so you can move around the pieces without any hassle. After that, connect each feature with a line. After creating your flowchart, you now need to write different inputs. Follow each input through the program to see which points it contacts as it moves through it. Make a list of them. Create the features needed to handle an unsupported input if you locate one.</p>
<br>
<h4>Step 5: Add pseudocode to your program</h4>
<p>Pseudocode is a plain-language explanation of an algorithm&#x27;s steps. In other words, your pseudocode is a step-by-step method for resolving the coding challenge. </p>
<br>
<h4>Step 6: Set deadlines to complete each step. </h4>
<p>Start with completing the most crucial features first, and then go step-by-step. </p>
<br><br>
<h3>‍<strong>Tip #7. Don&#x27;t Rush Things</strong></h3>
<p>There is a popular saying, &quot;Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day,&quot; so don&#x27;t expect to arrive at the solution immediately. If you rush, things will start falling apart, and you will get stuck. Make sure to understand the problem first and then start solving it step-by-step. If you don&#x27;t understand the problem, you can&#x27;t solve it. </p>
<p>Many people start coding without having prior knowledge and understanding of it and often get stuck. So, in order to solve any coding problem, it is important to correctly understand exactly what it is first. </p>
<p>When you understand the coding problem, write it down on a piece of paper and start solving it. Remember, code, syntax, and efficiency aren&#x27;t important right now, so don&#x27;t think about them just yet. If you think you can’t solve the problem, make sure to keep trying until you arrive at a solution. </p>
<br><br>
<h3>‍<strong>Tip #8. Keep Practicing</strong></h3>
<p>“Practice makes improvement.” This phrase stands true in coding as well. The more code problems you solve, the more proficient you become. Make sure to start with simpler problems and work your way up to more complex ones. </p>
<p>You can also go back to the problems you&#x27;ve already solved and tackle them in a new, or similar way. Remember that everything takes time, so don&#x27;t be too hard on yourself if you can&#x27;t solve a problem right away!</p>
