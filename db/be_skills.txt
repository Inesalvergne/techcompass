<p>A backend developer is responsible for writing backend codes and communicating when the user triggers any particular action. Today they<strong> have become the backbone of web development </strong>and they’re in high demand in the vast scale of companies. Whatever you do in your application, the back-end is responsible for that as they work behind the curtains. <strong>The integrations, logic, APIs, all are being taken care of by back-end developers</strong>. That’s why they are the foundation of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-development/?ref=gcse">web development.</a><p><img src=https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20220309002834/7-Skills-to-Become-a-Backend-Developer.png alt=7-Skills-to-Become-a-Backend-Developer><p>It is trending and has been resembled as one of the most desired jobs. But firstly, you need to understand the basics of backend development.<strong> A successful roadmap in backend development will start from the base itself i.e. in-depth knowledge of programming languages</strong> and will go along to applying it in real projects. Besides the fact, it is not mandated that every backend developer needs to follow the same strategy. Certain skill sets will define your career in backend development and those are the fundamental ones. So, today, we’re going to discuss <strong>the top 7 skills which are required to become a successful backend developer.</strong><div id=GFG_AD_gfg_mobile_336x280></div><p>Since we’ve just discussed how important a role of a backend developer is, now is the time to understand briefly about this role before we jump into the required skills.<h3>Back-End Developer</h3><p>A backend developer is responsible for writing backend codes of any website and how is it going to communicate when the user will trigger any particular action. Besides, they take care of the whole wireframe of the website, its architecture, coding, scripting, and database accessibility. Moreover, they are also responsible for debugging and testing the backend applications.<p>Before you move further, make sure that you are well aware of the following things first:<ul><li><strong>Working on Internet</strong><li><strong>How Does the Browser Work?</strong><li><strong>Basic OS Knowledge</strong></ul><p>Being a backend developer also requires you to understand the basic function of the Internet and how it works and connects with the server. Besides this having a little knowledge of OS (I/O, networking, terminal, etc.) is also recommended so that you can work smoothly.<h3 style=text-align:center>7 Skills for Backend Developers</h3><h3>1. Back-End Programming Language</h3><p>In the field of development, <strong>language is the base</strong> and for that, you need to have a strong command of languages. This is how a backend developer is going to create a solid frame and its connectivity via servers. The desired outputs and functionality will work only if you’ve mastered the backend programming language. <strong>There are three major languages that giant IT firms use Java, Python, and PHP.</strong><ul><li><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/><i><strong>Java</strong></i></a><i>:</i> It is one of the most robust programming languages, that is used by many big tech companies (Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) that have been using <strong>Java due to its portability and extreme performance</strong>. Today it is being used to create applications and dynamic websites with high functionality.<li><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/><i><strong>Python</strong></i></a><i>: </i>This is used to <strong>automate tasks, perform data analysis, build websites</strong>, and much more. It also supports a different range of programming styles such as functions, Object-oriented, etc.<li><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/php/><i><strong>PHP</strong></i></a><i>:</i> It is also one of the highly used languages among developers today. PHP powers today more than <strong>80% of the websites</strong> and is a useful language for the back-end as it automates the task and eases the work of developers.</ul><h3>2. Knowledge of Front-End Technology</h3><p>So now you have the basic knowledge of backend programming languages, now it&#8217;s your turn to start with basic front-end language. Although it is not mandatory to master it, having basic skills is required for this role such as<strong> </strong><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/><strong>HTML</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css/><strong>CSS</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/><strong>JavaScript</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A programmer needs to have capabilities to give instructions to computers for communicating and for applying different algorithms. You need to have a good command of basic languages if you’re looking for a perfect output via coding.&nbsp;<p>A back-end developer needs to have a command and in-depth knowledge of Jscript as they’re the foundation of front-end development. While working on the back-end languages such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML will work as a pillar while writing codes.<strong> </strong><i><strong>JavaScript helps in adding elements and animations on a webpage which offers an engaging view for users whereas CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) gives a style, colors, and layout and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the sole of the website, just like humans have the skeleton, websites have too, known as HTML.&nbsp;</strong></i><strong> &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<h3>3. Knowledge of Backend Frameworks</h3><p>Once you’ve decided the language which you need to work upon, you need to brush up skills with the framework as well. <strong>The framework is a backbone of a language on a program/application on which you’re working</strong>. There are certain frameworks that you might consider working on while working as a back-end developer.<ul><li><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nodejs/><i><strong>NodeJs</strong></i></a><i>: </i>It’s an open-source and free platform built to support the backend coding of an application. It works on JavaScript and is one of the oldest and most popular frameworks so far. NodeJs is cross-platform and compatible with <strong>Windows, Linux, MacOs, </strong>etc.<li><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js/><i><strong>ExpressJs</strong></i></a><i>:</i> It’s another framework that is built on NodeJs. Due to<strong> its speed and deliverability,</strong> it is highly appraised among backend developers. ExpressJs is used to build APIs and is considered one of the best choices for building mobile and web applications.<li><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/django-tutorial/><i><strong>Django</strong></i></a><i>:<strong> </strong></i><strong>Compatible with Python,</strong> it is an open-source and free platform that has been highly appreciated and become popular among developers. The best part about Django is, it uses less code and power to craft rapid app development.</ul><h3>4. Version Control System</h3><p>It is also known as the source control which is responsible for any changes that have to be done from time to time. <strong>The version control system tracks every single modification of codes in a different database. </strong>This becomes more helpful when a developer makes a mistake and wants to reverse it back and it helps in protecting source code from any such incidents. These are some of the most popular version control systems for backend developers:<ul><li><i><strong>AWS Code Commit</strong>:</i> It is another version of the control system which is being<strong> hosted by Amazon</strong>. By using this, a user can easily store and manage data along with the source code. It is a highly secured platform managed by Git repository.<li><i><strong>GitHub</strong>: </i>Established in 2007, is an open-source community that has been designed to support the developers. Due to its availability over the cloud, anyone from anywhere can view the code and it also allows developers to collab and contribute as they want. With the help of this community, anyone can anywhere provide help for those who need and due to its popularity, <strong>today millions of users are associated with this platform.</strong><li><i><strong>GitLab</strong>:</i> It allows users to collab on a single platform and perform all the tasks. By doing so, it helps in reducing the time frame and increases productivity. In other terms,<strong> it allows teams to build perfect software with the help of a singular communication channel.</strong></ul><h3>5. Knowledge of Databases</h3><p>When you’re working on a project, you must understand that the storage of data is very crucial as they carry a large amount of information. So, it is a must to have a good command over the database. The backend developer is responsible for creating a relational mapping so that the data can be retrieved when required. Thus, to handle<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-dbms-database-management-system-set-1/?ref=gcse"> </a><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/>DBMS</a>, developers use<strong> </strong><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-tutorial/><strong>MySQL</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-tutorial/?ref=gcse"><strong>SQL</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/postgresql-tutorial/><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mongodb-tutorial/><strong>MongoDB</strong></a><strong>, </strong>etc.<h3>6. Knowledge of API</h3><p>Application Programming Interface or <strong>API is responsible for establishing connections between different applications.</strong> Just take an example, let’s say you are ordering some item from Alibaba via the mobile application, so here you’re establishing a connection with Alibaba’s API. Backend developers use these APIs to establish connections between different applications to enhance user experience. The most popular APIs among developers are<strong> JSON, SOAP, REST, GSON,</strong> etc.<h3>7. Server Handling</h3><p>Since backend developers are responsible to perform all the actions behind the curtains so it is a must to have a good command over handling the server. <strong>A server is a cloud system that provides all the useful information and offers services such as file storage, database, and security to other systems connected to that network</strong>. The details stored in the server are responsible for recovering, rearranging, stored information. Some of the best tools for server handling are <strong>Docker, Kubernetes, etc. &nbsp;</strong><h3>Income Graph of a Backend Developer</h3><p>If you’ll check the trend, the average income of a backend developer varies from country to country and the rough figure is estimated at around<strong> USD 110,000 annually (USA) and INR 6, 50,000 (India).</strong> However, this can vary depending upon the level of expertise and skillsets, and the company as well. If you’ll compare between the Front end and Back end then obviously backend gives a higher pay compared to the front because the logic is established from the backend and the structure of an app is being built by the backend team only.&nbsp;</p><br><div id=AP_G4GR_6></div><div id=personalNoteDiv class="clear hideIt"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class=noteHeaderText>My Personal Notes</span>
