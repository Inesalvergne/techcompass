He is unlikely to spend too much time evaluating your profile. From his point of view, he will be looking for bullet points to understand your capability and strength. He would really care about the manner your skills are listed, with some quick informatics points over it.</p><p><strong><em>Promote yourself in the heading section or can be said as about me. (For examples look at the reference below)</em></strong></p><p>Now that John is already impressed with your skills, he would like to know more about you. This also gives you a chance to prove your capabilities in a few more points, which will get John’s interest more towards your profile.</p><p><strong><em>Mention projects in a recent-first manner. (Full stack developer portfolio projects)</em></strong></p><p>Projects that you have worked on play a particularly key role in your profile getting selected or rejected.</p><p>As an example, if I say that the portfolio belongs to me, I will prefer to write details of the projects in a recent first manner than the oldest first. Keep yourself away from giving too many details as HRs usually have shorter attention spans and more attention to details.</p><p>Assuming I have worked on three projects till date, let’s see how we can put this on the portfolio in an effective manner.</p><ul><li>You can add full stack developer portfolio github links of your project too for more clarity and where “John” can see all call its implementation.</li><li>It can be as easy as providing project name first, trailing with technologies used in it and ending with small and informative description about it.</li><li>And most important try keeping in tabular form which separates all information in clear and readable format. Here is an example.</li></ul><table style="width:96%;margin-left:calc(4%)"><tbody><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Project Name</td><td style="width:50.0000%">XXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Technology Used</td><td style="width:50.0000%">Java, Angular, React, Mongo DB, XX, XX, etc.</td></tr><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Description</td><td style="width:50.0000%">ABC product was created to solve problem on hospitality domain, Problem which were solved using this product are xx, xx, xx</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now, what do you see here? First and foremost it is clear and easily readable. John, being a hiring manager, can easily list your achievements like the level of difficulty involved in a project, technologies used, and the hidden interpersonal skills you might possess.</p><p>Now we also have a chance to add a few more points to this table like your roles and responsibilities. Let’s visit the outcome.</p><p><strong><em>Below format of representing project details are the trend of <a href="https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/web-development/full-stack-developer-resume-writing-tips" target="_blank">writing resume</a>.</em></strong></p><table style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Project Name</td><td style="width:50.0000%">XXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Technology Used</td><td style="width:50.0000%">Java, Angular, React, Mongo DB, XX, XX, etc.</td></tr><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Description</td><td style="width:50.0000%">ABC product was created to solve problem on hospitality domain, Problem which were solved using this product are xx, xx, xx</td></tr><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Roles and Responsibilities</td><td style="width:50.0000%">As an individual contributor role, I was accountable for blah, blah and blah</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Isn’t it good more understandable and neater? <em>Yeah, all good but I am a fresher in this case what should I do</em>. No worries, go ahead and still you can add college projects if any.</p><p>Add all the informative information about your college project. Example shown below.</p><table style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Project Name</td><td style="width:50.0000%">XXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Technology Used</td><td style="width:50.0000%">Java, Angular, React, Mongo DB, XX, XX, etc.</td></tr><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Description</td><td style="width:50.0000%">ABC product was created to solve problem on hospitality domain, Problem which were solved using this product are xx, xx, xx</td></tr><tr><td style="width:50.0000%">Roles and Responsibilities</td><td style="width:50.0000%">As an individual contributor role, I was accountable for (list your responsibilities)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With coding/programming/developing, whatever you want to call it, becoming ever more popular, fewer people are going the traditional college route. Because of this, a lot of people are taking online courses from platforms like KnowledgeHut, or are going to Seminars.</p><p><a href="https://www.knowledgehut.com/web-development" target="_blank">What is web development course</a>? Click on the link given to get your queries resolved and explore the curriculum.</p><p>So, it's safe to say that John will recognize those full stack developer portfolio projects on your full stack developer portfolio as a class/college project. It is better to mention projects that you have contributed to and the outcome is showcased via links to the project repository.</p><p>Why not discuss one more key point about having projects - <strong><em>T</em></strong><strong><em>ry to choose a project from recent technologies, going into the market</em></strong>. &nbsp;We know that information technology is being evaluated day to day. Every day a new technology pops out on the market. Let your recruiter know that you have the necessary tech skills and you’re open to upskilling as the trend changes.</p><p>One example is the internet speed of KBPS when we first began and we are now streaming data in the range of GB per second. We have seen multiple page websites of an e-commerce site to single page applications built with Angular. Yeah, that’s the evolution of information technology.</p><h2 id="why-not-peep-into-some-examples"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Why Not Peep Into Some Examples</span></h2><p>If we take UI technologies, we started from HTML, CSS and Java Script to now having Angular React playing significant role in every UI project.</p><p>Same is with backend, it all started with C, C++ and now Java, Node and Python becoming the market leaders.</p><p>You should always try to put some full stack developer portfolio projects on your full stack developer portfolio website that resembles the area of development you are going into.</p><p>Such as being a full stack developer you want to include your own e-commerce website, with the front-end and backend technologies used, with the fully functional website URL for reference.</p><p><strong><em>Include quick 30 sec introduction video, quick and constructive</em></strong></p><p>Does video intro make any difference as I already have John’s attention towards my full stack developer portfolio?</p><p>Why not, what is the harm in getting 100 out of 100. And it makes your full stack developer portfolio a better full stack developer portfolio.</p><p><strong>The Infamous Introduction Video - About Me…</strong></p><p>Let me just start off by saying, please don’t include anything too personal. I get it, we all come from different backgrounds and some people are more open than others and just let this information fly.</p><ul><li>Have a quick note about yourself, a few points about your skills, projects, roles and responsibilities and do not forget to add your strength along with an accomplishment in your career you are proud of.</li><li>Try adding a solution you have provided to resolve any issues with some crazy but amazing idea you had. To gain some extra points.</li></ul><p>A little personal touch is nice, like if you can play the guitar really well or some other achievements that you are really proud of. A few hobbies of yours can also be a deal-breaker.</p><p><strong>About me section is the perfect place to promote yourself as a professional.</strong></p><p>The major point here is talking about the professional you, what you like about the field you work in, why you are passionate about it, and <a href="https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/web-development/full-stack-development-hottest-developer-skill" target="_blank">what latest skills</a> you have that make you desirable. The about me is a great place to organically explain all of that.</p><p><strong><em>Links to download all relevant Document such as Resume, Cover letter or Project documents.</em></strong></p><p><em>But why does John need this much details?</em></p><p>Why not? John is looking towards you to be in his company working and generating assets and revenue for the organization. Let’s look into one example...</p><p>We have already provided all project details, but as said earlier having your full stack developer portfolio github links included in your portfolio website will make more impact.</p><p>When talking to people you might get to a point where you can slip in some business talk. So, it is a great idea to promote yourself a little bit. Well... You’re going to give them your full stack developer portfolio site to check you out, right? It is a good idea to keep your resume on your full stack developer portfolio while you show your stellar website because if they like you, they might feel “Hey I might hire this guy”. At this point, your resume will be right there waiting for them to click and see or download.</p><p>I hope you got the point of having download links. It is easy for anyone to get the right information anytime they want to check on the resources you put for download.</p><p>Now let us discuss how to put more impact on your full stack developer portfolio.
