            <p>The answer to this question can tell you a lot about job applicant’s interest in programming. People who start learning languages when they’re young usually know languages like JavaScript, which is used for making interactive websites. Those who learned languages like Java and C++ probably didn’t develop a sincere interest in programming until they went to college.</p>
            <p>What to look for in an answer:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Learn about applicant’s experience</li>
             <li>Discover languages the applicant knows</li>

           <p><br> “C++ was the first programming language in an academic class. Before I went to college, though, I had picked up a fair amount of JavaScript and Python. I remember making my first math-based game with JavaScript. I still enjoy using those languages because they’re flexible enough that you can use them in a lot of contexts.”</p>

            <p>It’s natural for computer programmers to hide their weaknesses. As an employer, though, you need to find each person’s weaknesses and strengths. How someone answers this question can give you insight into the person’s personality as well as what parts of projects the applicant may not enjoy.</p>

            <p>New languages emerge frequently. Knowing what an applicant has learned recently will tell you whether that person has an interest in keeping up with newer languages. Some of the programmers that you interview may only know older, established languages like C++ and Python. Adventurous programmers who keep up with the latest languages may know how to use Julia, Rust and Swift.</p>

            <p>Programmers create websites, apps, software and other types of digital programs to support businesses. Their ability to work with other programmers and collaborate on projects ensures the correction of errors and adherence to deadlines. This question helps interviewers decide whether a candidate has to experience and personality traits that enable them to work well with others.</p>
            <p>A candidate's answer should emphasize:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Verbal communication</li>

Because we were working in the same workspace, we could easily ask each other questions about code strings, testing issues or potential ideas to improve the security of programs. It was also a great opportunity for me, as an entry-level programmer to learn about different languages, coding terminology and programming procedures."</p>
